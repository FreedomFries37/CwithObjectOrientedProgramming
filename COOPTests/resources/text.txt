History of Technology Paper Four 
The ability to transport ourselves better has been a focus of human technological progress 
for as long as humans could use tools. The ability to get from place to place with ease is a 
problem that always has a better solution. For years, humans had to rely on horses as the main 
form of transportation. However, the trouble with animals is that they are expensive, have to be 
fed, and require training. Eventually, during the industrial revolution, mechanical solutions were 
eventually invented. The train was the first instance of an entirely mechanical solution to large 
distance ground travel. However, trains weren’t personal, had to adhere to a strict schedule, and 
could only go where ever track was laid. It wasn’t until the invention of the affordable car that 
transportation was truly revolutionized. For the first time, humans could travel anywhere in vast 
distances in a relatively short amount of time for cheap. Society began to adapt around the 
invention of the car. Suburbanization began to skyrocket as it became easier to live outside of 
cities. Towns were being built with the idea of driving in mind, with large parking lots becoming 
iconic features of the long main streets being built all over America. Surely, the invention of the 
car rocked society in a large way. Now, one hundred years after the introduction of Ford’s Model 
T, a new technology involving the way in which we transport ourselves has the potential to 
change everything, again. As computational power increased, and more advanced sensors have 
been invented, it has become apparent that the possibility of the large-scale implementation of 
self-driving vehicles is upon us. The technology has the potential to change society similar to 
how the original car. Although development has been very gradual in the last few years, 
autonomous vehicle technology has the potential to change the way we live by dramatically 
altering the way infrastructure is built, how cities are planned, and the fundamental ways in 
which we view transportation. 
The development of self-driving cars has been a very long process, although recent 
technological advancements and superior processing power has rapidly increased the rate of 
development. Much of the technology and concepts that are fueling modern testing of 
autonomous cars were actually theorized and created by the Eureka PROMETHEUS Projects 
(Daily) from 1987 to 1995. Eureka is an international, European based, government research 
organization, which was funded with 749,000,000€ for research and development into 
autonomous vehicles (Eureka). The work that the organization did resulted in the development of 
the standard set of systems used for automated driving is still used today. These systems included 
the 4D approach of mapping, recursive estimation, and Clothoid modeling of road curvature 
(Daily). All of these technologies were significant in the advancement of self-driving capabilities 
and are in use today for the limited amount of automation that cars are already employing. 
However, these are not the only things that would enable a self-driving car. For an automated 
vehicle to function, it’s most basic necessity would be its perception. The ability for a robot to 
“see” is called machine vision and is a rapidly advancing technology. For a car to be trusted to 
drive itself, it must be able to recognize everything that’s going on around it. This is done 
through a multitude of sensors, ranging from infrared cameras, laser scanners, LiDAR, short- and 
long-range radar, ultrasonic sonar, and video cameras (Access Science). All of these combined 
are what makes up the “vision” of the robotic car. From the data it gathers from these sensors, 
the car has to then attempt to construct a model of the world. The reason why the car has so 
many sensors is the complexity of constructing such a model. The model of the world has to be 
constructed at a rapid pace, due to both the speed the vehicle is traveling at and the rapidly ever- 
changing state of the world. An improper representation of the world could lead to disaster, as 
the car could collide into something it wasn’t aware existed. However, self-driving cars aren’t 
the only type of cars that are taking advantage of this technology. 
Today, cars are already being built and sold for common consumer with semi- 
autonomous functions built in. Many cars are now being built with detectors on the side to warn 
drivers about cars in their blind spot. Although the car itself doesn’t react to this information, this 
type of development is a showcase of how car developers are trying to push their products to 
operate more safely. As an increase in safety is a large part of the push for automated driving, 
any step is a significant one. However, mere blind spot detectors are not the only part of the 
automated vehicle suite that has appeared in consumer cars. Many cars today are starting to 
include systems that make the car semi-autonomous. Many cars, such as the more expensive 
Cadillac CT6 and even the Honda Civic, are including lane following with adaptive cruise 
control (Daily). These cars, when above a certain speed limit while on a highway are able to 
automatically adjust the speed they are going at based on the speed of the vehicle in front of 
them and will warn the driver of any sudden changes in condition requiring the driver’s attention. 
This level of automation is referred automation to as Level 2 by the US Department of 
Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, whose scale goes from level 0 
to level 4 (Guerra). Tesla’s autopilot system is much more advanced than this, and actually has 
the ability to turn by itself, and suggest when to change lanes. These systems differ from the idea 
of fully autonomous driving cars because of their lack of ability to make decisions. When a car is 
using the speed adjusting cruise control, although it is reacting to the world around it, it is not 
doing to intelligently. It’s not deciding that it should reduce its speed because the car in front of 
it is but is slowing down just because it’s hard wired to do so. The ability to make decisions is 
the defining factor of a truly autonomous car, and what is required for a self-driving car to make 
it on the streets. 
Decision making is one of the most difficult problems facing the development of 
autonomous cars. An ability that humans take for granted is our intuition. Humans are able to 
reason and come to conclusions based on the state of the world around them and are able to fill 
in the holes in the information available to them. Furthermore, humans are able to learn at a rapid 
rate. Modeling this with computers is incredibly difficult and requires lots of computational 
power. Although recently computers having become significantly stronger computationally, they 
are nowhere near the power that the human brain has. Additionally, a self-driving car couldn’t 
only react to the world around it. It would also have to be able to predict and reason how it’s 
actions could affect the world. A driver can’t stay in one lane on one road forever, they need to 
turn at some point. A self-driving car would have to be able to reason that a decision it makes 
wouldn’t endanger any other car as a result of its decision. Moreover, a self-driving car needs a 
certain amount of insurance that the people would act predictably and cleanly. However, in real 
life this isn’t often the case. In environments with less strict driving regulations, traffic is 
significantly more unpredictable, filled with unexpected traversal patterns, unexpected scenarios, 
and drivers with unpredictable driving habits (Daily). Training an artificial intelligence to predict 
every possible scenario is impossible, and therefore would require an agent with incredibly high 
generalization. The best way for these agents to learn is through training, unfortunately training 
is slowed down by many factors. Notably, the cars are often locked to a small geographic area, 
are required to much training in real-time instead of simulated, and the cars themselves are 
expensive to build. Overall, as it currently stands fully automated driving is a fantasy, but 
definitely a promising one. Eventually, when fully automated driving cars become the norm, it 
will be expected that the world will change drastically around it. 
A significant change that would be experienced as the result of the use of self-driving 
cars would be the ways in which cities are designed. Cities will probably be the first place where 
the introduction of self-driving cars will see changes in infrastructure. The high population living 
there and commuting in and out of the city will require that cities be well adapted for the mass 
changes. As the result of the introduction of automated vehicles, the demand for parking will be 
shifted, as it becomes feasible for cars to transport themselves, so parking becomes less 
necessary. Cities will begin to develop “parking belts” where cars will be parked in the day 
(Zakharenko). An interesting side effect of the change to self-driving cars is that it’s predicted 
that traffic will actually increase, but this doesn’t mean that there will be an increase in 
congestion (Zakharenko). This means that although there will be more cars on the road, the car 
won’t be slowed down as heavily due to interactions with other cars. Robotic cars would be 
much more efficient with their actions, and less-likely to make unexpected moves in the fast- 
pace of city driving. The convenience of having self-driving cars would change where both 
people and companies choose to locate themselves, as living in a city would become even easier, 
as self-driving cars would effectively remove many of the downsides of having a car in a city, 
namely finding a location to park the car. However, due to the complexity of driving in a city, 
cities would probably be the last place where cars would be fully automated. Besides the large 
number of other cars, there would also be high levels of pedestrians, significantly greater than 
the near zero pedestrians seen on highways. Pedestrians are even more unpredictable than cars, 
and even more dangerous for the car. People move much more unexpectedly when not in cars, 
because they don’t have to move several thousand pounds of metal to turn. Furthermore, there’s 
no room for error when hitting a pedestrian. Although hitting anything would definitely be bad, 
hitting an essentially defenseless pedestrian is even worse. Despite all of this, companies and 
countries have begun to work on creating and testing their own self-driving vehicles. 
Some of the largest innovators and testers in the self-driving cars industry are companies 
trying to use the technology for profit. They are attempting to use the technology as a part of a 
service, instead of just the car itself. Waymo, formerly the Google self-driving car project, is a 
subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. which is attempting to bring self-driving car technology to the people 
by the means of a taxi service. Similar to the services that are provide by Lyft and Uber, a person 
could request a Waymo car to pick them up at a location and bring them to a specified 
destination. Although somewhat limited in scope, the idea behind this part of the project is to 
show the potential of self-driving cars to the public. However, Waymo’s mission does end with 
its taxi service. The next step for Waymo will be the automation of the trucking industry 
(Waymo). The advancement into the trucking industry could have a much more profound and 
world-changing effect then just as a taxi service. Trucking is a critical component of the 
American economy, and how many goods are transported around the country. However, there’s a 
limiting factor to how much can be transported: the humans driving the trucks. Truckers have 
required number of hours they’re allowed to sleep, and a maximum number of hours they’re 
actually allowed to drive per day. However, if these requirements were removed by getting rid of 
the human element, the new economic activity generated by the automated trucks would be 
massive. These types of improvements would be the first changes that would be seen as self- 
driving technology becomes accepted by larger portions of the industry, and as more uses are 
found for them. 
Trucking isn’t the only use for self-driving vehicles, and many other industries are 
finding ways to utilize them. For example, in India companies are attempting to use self-driving 
cars for uses in agriculture and mining (Daily). Other companies are also coming up with even 
more creative services using automated cars. Kroger is utilizing self-driving cars for delivering 
grocery items directly to customers. The vehicles being used for this have no steering wheel and 
no room for a driver, a deviation from previous self-driving cars in use (Busewitz). However, 
these delivery cars are monitored by a “shadow car”, with a driver in it who is able to stop or 
control the self-driving car. This type of solution shows one of the main problems facing self- 
driving cars. Although technically the car is self-driving, it still requires a person to monitor the 
activity and actions of the car. Getting self-driving cars to be able to navigate roads without 
being a danger is truly the hardest problem currently facing these services as well, and a large 
part of the reason why these services have such slow rollout. People don’t want to feel even more 
unsafe on the streets, and investors don’t want to invest in technology that could be potentially 
harmful. Thus, as of now self-driving cars for the average consumer are a long time away from 
hitting the market. 
However, the slow progress does not mean that self-driving cars are not in our future. On 
the contrary, all of this progress points to these self-driving cars eventually hitting the market. 
Self-driving cars have the potential to change everyone’s personal lives. Self-driving cars will 
change how people view commuting and traveling long distance. Instead of having to actually 
drive everywhere, and therefore be incredibly mentally focused for long periods of time, self- 
driving cars would enable people to act many of same ways they could on current public 
transportation. People could watch television shows, watch movies, read a book, sleep, or 
anything else that they couldn’t with their hands attached to the wheel and eyes on the road at all 
times. As a result, people would probably be more willing to travel longer distances for their 
work and people will move even farther away from cities. Self-driving cars will also probably 
change how public transportation will work as well. Buses will become automated, which will 
allow for more public transportation that can run at all times of the day. Any industry that 
requires having a large number of drivers and cars will be able to change the ways in which their 
company operates. Companies like Uber and Lyft, who already have been experimenting with 
self-driving cars, would most likely move to providing the self-driving cars instead of hiring 
drivers. Mail delivery would probably be done by automated vans, maybe utilizing drones to 
physically deliver the letters and packages to their intended destination. Overall, the introduction 
of autonomous vehicles will allow for the continued rise of the culture of convenience that has 
emerged in the past few years by extending on the idea of services such as Amazon Prime: to 
deliver products to customers as fast as possible. 
A fascinating aspect of the rise of self-driving cars will be how it changes the workforce. 
As a result of self-driving cars, many people will find themselves without jobs. Almost any job 
that previously required having a driver will no longer exist, as it will be replaced by a robot. 
However, in its wake hopefully even better jobs will emerge, as people are needed to maintain 
the cars, both the code behind it and the physical car itself. Services that utilize these self-driving 
cars will need people to do lots work behind the scenes in order to make sure operations go 
smoothly. However, this does not mean there won’t be massive push back against these self- 
driving cars. Already, taxi companies are pushing hard against companies like Waymo because it 
threatens their status quo. It’s easier for people to continue to do what they already do versus 
learning a new skill. So although the new jobs that could be created by the self-driving cars 
would most likely be more lucrative than previous jobs, the uptake by the public would slowed 
down dramatically. Slow down by popular opposition will most likely be a constant during the 
beginning years of implementation. As of right now, there is a lot of mistrust towards self- 
driving cars, for a multitude of reasons. For one, it’s incredibly hard to prove that the technology 
is actually safe. Last year, a woman was killed in an accident with one of Uber’s test self-driving 
cars, and development into the cars had to be stopped for several months as a result. Not only 
does this hurt public perception of autonomous vehicles, but it dramatically slows down the rate 
of growth for the intelligence of these cars. The cars require being on the road to learn, so any 
downtime is a massive loss for the future of the technology. Furthermore, there will certainly be 
pushback by people who don’t like the idea of giving up their ability to drive a car. There’s a 
certain sense of freedom associated with the ability to drive a car, and people will be afraid to 
give up that right. Mostly likely initial automated cars will still have a steering wheel and pedals 
in them, not only to deal with possible errors that car could make, but also as a compromise with 
those who want to still be able to control the car. Most likely, the steering wheel will never 
actually go away. 
Ultimately, self-driving vehicles is a technology that has a potential to cause a massive 
change within our society. Development of automated vehicles has seen a dramatic increase in 
interest in the last few years, and autonomous vehicle technology has the potential to change the 
way we live by dramatically altering the way infrastructure is built, how cities are planned, and 
the fundamental ways in which we view transportation. Many countries and companies have 
spending large amounts of money on the research and development of these technologies 
because of the possibilities they could provide. There’s no knowing what exactly will come out 
of having these cars will give us, besides more convenient ways of traveling, but there’s already 
promising signs for the future by way of the new services that are already using the technology. 
Furthermore, another effect of developing self-driving cars will be the massive leaps in artificial 
intelligence technology that will be created as a result. For self-driving cars to exist, we will need 
artificial intelligence significantly stronger than what we have now, which will not only be able 
to see the world, but also understand the semantics behind what it’s seeing. This technology 
would have many other uses besides just autonomous cars and would further revolutionize the 
world. Overall, the large-scale implementation of self-driving cars will most likely be a 
technology that is seen in the near future that has the potential to alter the way we view and use 
transportation.
